### **Yoga Pose Detection Using YOLOv8**

**Description:**  
This project implements a state-of-the-art pose detection system using YOLOv8, focusing on detecting and analyzing yoga poses in images. The system leverages a labeled yoga pose dataset to train and validate the YOLOv8 pose estimation model, providing bounding boxes and keypoints for accurate detection. The project includes steps for data preprocessing, model inference, and results visualization.

**Key Features:**  
- **Automated Pose Detection**: Identifies yoga poses in images using YOLOv8's pose estimation capabilities.  
- **Dataset Utilization**: Uses the publicly available Yoga Poses Dataset from Kaggle for training and validation.  
- **Bounding Box and Keypoint Extraction**: Outputs detailed pose information with bounding boxes and keypoints for body joints.  
- **Visualization**: Displays results with detected poses superimposed on the images.  
- **Reproducibility**: Provides a structured and documented workflow for ease of replication.

**Technologies and Tools Used:**  
- **YOLOv8**: Lightweight and efficient model for object and pose detection.  
- **Python Libraries**: `cv2`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` for data handling and visualization.  
- **Kaggle Dataset**: Integrated using `kagglehub`.  
- **Framework**: Ultralytics YOLO API for Python and CLI.

**How It Works:**  
1. **Dataset Integration**: Downloads and processes a labeled yoga pose dataset.  
2. **Model Inference**: Uses YOLOv8's pre-trained weights (`yolov8n-pose.pt`) to predict poses in images.  
3. **Result Visualization**: Outputs images with annotated bounding boxes and keypoints for detected poses.  
4. **Data Analysis**: Extracts pose-related information (coordinates, confidence scores, and class labels) for further analysis.

**Future Enhancements:**  
- Expand dataset with additional yoga poses for improved generalization.  
- Fine-tune the YOLOv8 model for better detection accuracy.  
- Integrate real-time pose detection capabilities using webcam or live video streams.  

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation guide, making it an excellent resource for researchers and developers interested in pose estimation and computer vision applications.
